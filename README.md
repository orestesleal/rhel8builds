NOTES: The builds stored here comes with no warranty at all, those a personal builds stripped down from 
       most (non-important) components, like headers, etc. Use at your own risk.

 1. YASM 1.3.0  - RHEL-8.1-x86_64 build, I've included just the binaries (3) and man pages (5)
    for this package to keep it small and simple so anybody can go ahead and start coding.
    I was not able to find the yasm package as a ``RPM`` so for that reason I made this build.
